# SkipWorld

Basic game made with the phaser JS html5 game engine just for learning/experimentation etc.

Waste drops from the sky you have to match the items to the waiting skip to recycle the item or put it in the plain mixed skip if there's no matching waste type.

You get points for 10 points for correctly matching the waste types and recycling, you get one point for putting waste in the mixed skip.
Any waste that misses the skips is -10 points!
